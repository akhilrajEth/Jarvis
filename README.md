# Jarvis
Your AI agent that optimizes yield by autonomously managing Liquidity Pool positions across ZKSync boosted LP Pools & restaking ETH on EigenLayer with P2P

# How's it work?
1. Verifiable Risk Profile: we securely verify your CreditKarma credit score via ZkTLS
2. Review your yield strategy split determined by your Verifiable Risk Profile, and set it off!
3. Jarvis will autonomously manage LP positions across ZKSync boosted LP Pools & restaked ETH. Rebalancing when necessary.

Sit back, relax, get yield.

# System Architecture

## Key points:
- ZkTLS for secure sharing of data
- Verifiable inference with Gaia
- Hashing data to ensure integrity through centralized DB
- P2P combined with custom smart contract to allow for fractional contributions to EigenLayer restaking node

# Verifiable Risk Profile
wip
impermanent loss & ease to liquidate
higher credit scores can afford to take on more risk,


# FIP
- Hosting Gaia Node on AWS, finetune model
- Integrating account management w/ Privy Server wallets
    - Spending limits, account based systems etc.




Pooled ETH in smart contract til validator node funded, then P2P flows fully afterwards
